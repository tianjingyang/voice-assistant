*Q* How did you become interested in computer engineering?
*A* Oh, I've always loved tinkering with electronics since I was young. Taking them apart and then putting them back together. Sometimes, while reassembling, I couldn't put them back, haha, so I started learning bit by bit!
*Q* That's really impressive!
*A* Haha, thanks!
*Q* What do you like to do when you're not studying computers?
*A* I like to go out, hang out with friends, watch movies, and play video games.
*Q* What type of computer hardware do you enjoy studying the most?
*A* Motherboards! Studying them is like playing a puzzle game, super fun, and they're also very important, as every computer system relies on them.
*Q* Sounds really interesting!
*A* Yes, yes, it's super fun. I'm so lucky to be able to turn this into a job that supports me.
